ANDRAX is a Advanced Penetration Testing Platform for Desktop, Android and ARM boards! The development of ANDRAX began on 08/09/2016 (DD/MM/YYYY) only for people in Brazil and only for Android devices. ANDRAX has been fully redefined and reloaded on 05/10/2018 (DD/MM/YYYY) open to the international public. On 05/04/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) ANDRAX has been ported to be used in Desktop computers too! ANDRAX allow devices to become a weapon for Advanced Penetration Testing and Red Team operations. ANDRAX is developed by Weidsom Nascimento of The Cracker Technology - Advanced Pentest. Why ANDRAX is better? Let's see why ANDRAX is the best Penetration Testing Platform... Portable ANDRAX is portable for any Modern computers, Android Smartphone using Android 5+ with space left and any ARM board like Raspberry Pi... ANDRAX is a Platform! Not an ISO! Not an ROM! ANDRAX is installed in user space. Unlike shit's like Kali, Parrot, NetHunter... that need replace your entire system, ANDRAX can be easily installed in the top of your current system without change it. With ANDRAX you are free to use every distro or ROM that you like and want ! Freedom is the key for any real hacker ! HardBased ANDRAX uses the most advanced structure inside the default Linux structure, this mean that ANDRAX can isolate process and install things with conflicting libs and resources in the same environment. With HardBased we have a secured environment to run untrusted codes and/or deploy some types of tests that is not possible in others systems. Modern ANDRAX is a modern platform. We have new tools that is not included on others systems, we like the idea of give new tools and resources for professionals, others platforms are made by dinosaurs that like old things which not work on nowadays. Stable ANDRAX is a stable platform, so your system never will break, we like put things in a infinity running loop, so we make our platform stable only updating things that is really needed and tools which has fast development, all is extensively tested to you get the best experience in Advanced Ethical Hacking. More tools ANDRAX has more tools and resources than other platforms. We like to give to our users the maximum of power as possible, our users are Advanced Ethical Hackers and Penetration Testers that can't waste time fixing bugs or installing things in the system, so we make everything available for them. Optimized ANDRAX is extremely lightweight if compared with others systems, others systems require around 50GB of free space, ANDRAX only need 18GB to run at 100%. Lightweight ANDRAX is extremely lightweight if compared with others systems, others systems require around 40GB of free space, ANDRAX only need 15GB to run at 100%. Artificial intelligence ANDRAX have AI systems resources dedicated to Hacking. Machine Learning in Ethical Hacking is a grow up area nowadays and ANDRAX is in touch with it.

Android has a SoC with a powerful Bluetooth chipset with modern BLE capabilities, you don't need use a external Bluetooth adapter as dumbs do! You just need your smartphone! How to enable Bluetooth in ANDRAX Android interact with the Bluetooth module using a serial port device who is created by the SoC Bluetooth driver, this allow us kill the Android Bluetooth interface and enable our own HCI interface attaching to this serial port, by this way we have a so fast connection with our Bluetooth module the connection speed is faster than any external adapter! (ANDRAX in top, again!) Finding the serial port Find the serial port to use in Android is pretty easy, everyone can easily find it without any help... but if you are a dumb created by Offensive Security we will help you! Just past the following commands on a ANDRAX recovery shell and you will be able to find your device serial port for Bluetooth connections: su cd /;cat *.rc | grep -i \"bluetooth\" | grep -i \"net_bt_stack\" | grep -i \"\\/dev\" After run the commands you will see a result like this: Now you know that your serial port for Bluetooth connections is located at \" /dev/ttyS0 \", whats next? The serial speed Now we will need attach to the serial port but to do that you need discover the \"baud\" speed of the serial port, we will go back to the ANDRAX shell and past the following command: sudo stty -F /dev/<your serial port> You will be able to see the result like this: As we can see my Bluetooth chipset have the speed of 3.000.000 bauds per second (bps) or 3 Megabits per second which is a very, very high speed for a local physical connection! We will use a low range speed because this chipset speed is shared with the entire modem SoC, this mean that is used by Mobile Network, WiFi, Bluetooth and any other type of connectivity chipset like NFC. For 99.9% of attack types we will use the speed of 115200 bauds per second that is more than a good speed. Attaching to the serial port We will use hciattach to attach to the serial port and create a hci interface, the basic syntax of the hciattach command is: sudo hciattach -s 115200 /dev/ttyS0 any 3000000 sudo : To get root privileges hciattach : The command to attach to the serial port -s 115200 : The initial speed to we work /dev/ttyS0 : The serial port device block any : The device manufacturer type 3000000 : My real device speed We have the device setup complete, now we will power up the interface with hciconfig, hciconfig has a syntax similar with the old ifconfig: sudo hciconfig hci0 up sudo : To get root privileges hciconfig : The command to manage the interface hci0 : The interface to power up up : The subcommand to up the interface Now everything is fine, our hci interface is up and running.

ANDRAX has the most Advanced Terminal Emulator for Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing on Android, our Dragon Terminal is dedicated for ANDRAX, Dragon Terminal allows a wide variety of customizations and implementations. Others systems like: NetHunter, Parrot for Android, Termux, LinuxDeploy... uses really ugly, old and useless terminals! Dragon Notification Dragon Terminal uses a Advanced notification service system to prevent Android from close your running works (NetHunter can't do that) In Dragon Notification you have a option to \"Acquire\" a \"Wake LOCK\" FLAG that will say to Android don't fuck up with your terminal, so others applications never will stop yours running works and the CPU will be entire available to terminal spawned process. Special Keys Dragon Terminal has the most Advanced built-in Special Keys to optimize your works and the keys are customizables Special Keys in \"extended\" mode Advanced Multi Windows terminal Dragon Terminal is the terminal who has the most Advanced Multi Window system, our multi windows is lightweight and beautiful at same time, NetHunter and Termux has really ugly and nonfunctional systems. You can open several tools and tasks in Dragon Terminal Windows. Recovery Shell Dragon Terminal is built with a recovery shell to allow you directly access the Android Shell without pass trough ANDRAX shell. This is useful when you need do some tasks in the Android context or test, fix something. The Recovery Shell can be accessed by long pressing Dragon Terminal icon our using the Dragon Terminal menu. Change SHELL user Our Dragon Terminal has the ability to change the shell \"Login user\", by default the login user for Dragon Terminal shell is \"andrax\" but if you are a monkey from Offensive Security who don't know use another user than root, you are able to enable root login by default on Dragon Terminal with the option: \"ANDRAX Shell USER\" Now every time that you open a new window or the terminal the selected user will be used! Insecure Action ! Offensive Security and Kali dumbs created a wrong vision that you need run things as root but this is a so insecure action that you is supposed to never do! Mount Storage ANDRAX runs in a secure container mode that prevent things runs out to Android space, like everything else, the container is not impenetrable but offer a really good security layer! Anyway, some dumbs (created by Offensive Security) want mount the Android storage space inside the ANDRAX container, this is a really insecure action but if you want enable it just use the Dragon Terminal \"Mount storage\" option. Now the content of the \"/sdcard\" (Android Internal Storage, don't be dumb!) is accessible inside ANDRAX container by /sdcard path Initial Command Dragon Terminal provides a way for users to define an initial command that will be executed whenever a new terminal window is created, this option is accessible in: Settings -> General Settings -> Initial Command Now, every time that you open a new window the custom command will be added. Bell Dragon Terminal is a Advanced Terminal that have the most important Linux distributions terminal emulators capabilities, bell is one the function that others terminals not provide. With this function when a error or a illegal action occur the terminal will alert you with a sound This function is enabled by default but can be disabled in: Settings -> General Settings -> Bell Vibrate Vibrate is a option that is used to super complement the Bell function, when a error or a illegal action occur, this option is enabled by default Can be disabled in: Settings -> General Settings -> Bell Full Screen By default Dragon Terminal is launched in Full Screen mode to preserve more space to draw the lines and allow the user run tools in the more big area as possible, this feature can be disabled by default in: Settings -> UI Settings -> Full Screen If disabled you will see the \"Status bar\" with notifications and others type of trash every in top of Dragon Terminal Hide Toolbar This option allow Dragon Terminal hide the toolbar every time that soft keyboard is in screen, this allow you type and see to window with the maximum size as possible Can be disabled in: Settings -> UI Settings -> Hide Toolbar Toolbar auto hide in Full Screen mode ! The Toolbar will be hide in Fullscreen mode even if Hide Toolbar is disabled Next tab animation Change the positional animation when a tab window is closed, the default is switch to the previous tab but you can enable this option to change to the next one (if exist). Can be enabled in: Settings -> UI Settings -> Next tab animation Show extra keys This option allow Dragon Terminal draw the Special Keys that helps in the use of tools that need some keys like; arrows, Ctrl, Alt, Tab, Esc, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End... Is a extremely useful function (That lacks in other \"platforms\") but if you don't want use this, can be disabled in: Settings -> UI Settings -> Show Extra Keys If disabled every new window tab will be opened without the Special Keys, the previous windows will remain with it enabled until be closed. Custom font types Dragon Terminal allow you to change the terminal font type, you can use one of the defined font type or use a custom .ttf file Source Code Pro by Default ! Dragon Terminal use the Source Code Pro font type by default Color Scheme The Color Scheme of Dragon Terminal is fully customizable, you can use our predefined color schemes or create your new color scheme from scratch or using a template Foreground affect Special Keys ! The Special Keys colors is linked with Foreground color so if you change the foreground color to \"red\" the Special Keys will be red too! ZSH SHELL unlike other decadent platforms terminals like: Kali, NetHunter, Termux, Parrot... that use old shells line \"bash\" and sh, ANDRAX use ZSH in Dragon Terminal. ZSH is the most advanced shell for productive work! The best option for Advanced Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing! Fully optimized with plugins and customizations, thanks to oh-my-zsh. Custom themes Oh-My-ZSH implementation allow us use a big variety of themes for our shell that make ANDRAX looks the way that you want Custom GNZH ! By default the ZSH Shell of ANDRAX uses a custom version of the \"gnzh\" theme Auto complete The ANDRAX ZSH Shell is equiped with a Advanced Auto Complete to improve your works!

A modded Kernel is NOT needed for ANDRAX use, 99,9% of attacks never will need a custom Kernel but for somethings is useful a Kernel with more features that a normal Android Kernel. The Problem here is that manufactures uses different hardwares and chipsets for any smartphone model so is impossible create a 100% accurate tutorial but ANDRAX users are Advanced users by default so a Kernel build is pretty simple for them What you need to build a Kernel? A Linux machine Knowledge in compilation (C/C++ Coders) Knowledge in Linux shell (Basic Linux) Knowledge in Android development (ROM Modding, Porting) A CROSS Compiler Your device tree Download the right Compiler To build a Kernel for Android you need the right compiler, if your device is ARM (armv7l) you will use the ARM-EABI-4.8 if your device is ARMv8 or AARCH64 you will use AARCH64-LINUX-ANDROID-4.9 The device tree The device tree is extremely necessary to complete the process of build the Kernel, in many cases some drivers are only found in device tree, every device has a specific type of tree and a lot of things changed in the \"system as root\" partition type in the newer Android versions, read more about system as root here Check All Drivers The most common cause of \" bootloop \" is not include or compile all needed drivers in ramdisk or builtin space Exporting Every device has a better way to make the Kernel, you will need check your device Kernel source for complete instructions (generally in github) but some steps are made by default, and one of these steps are the exporting phase. You will need export some variables in the terminal that you will compile your Kernel. export ARCH=arm export SUBARCH=arm export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/mythical/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.8/bin/arm-eabi- The above is the example of configuration if your device is ARM (armv7l), the below example is to use if your device is ARMv8 (aarch64) export ARCH=arm64 export SUBARCH=arm64 export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/mythical/toolchain64/bin/aarch64-linux-android- Change the Cross Compile PATH Make sure that you are using the right path of your extracted your toolchain, don't be dumb like Kali users! Using the defconfig All the Kernel sources will have one or more defconfig these files are located at: /kernel-source-path/arch/your arch/configs but you will be able to see your defconfig options using the command: make help In my case i'll use the j3xlte_permissive_defconfig which is the best one for me, make sure that you will use the right defconfig for your device, now we need type this in the terminal: make your_defconfig Ok, now our base .config for the Kernel has been created, now we will customize it, to do that we will type: make menuconfig and we will get a pseudo terminal interface to we work Now is time to customize it, follow the next pages of this topic to the instructions about the categories of customizations","title":"Introduction to Kernel Building"},{"location":"introduction-to-kernel-building/#how-to-build-a-kernel-for-fully-andrax-usage","text":"A modded Kernel is NOT needed for ANDRAX use, 99,9% of attacks never will need a custom Kernel but for somethings is useful a Kernel with more features that a normal Android Kernel.
