ANDRAX is a Penetration Testing Platform developed for Android Smartphones and ARM boards, ANDRAX has the ability to run on Android so it behaves like a common Linux distribution, But more powerful than a common distribution! The development of ANDRAX began on 08/09/2016 (DD/MM/YYYY) only for people in Brazil ANDRAX has been fully redefined and reloaded on 05/10/2018 (DD/MM/YYYY) open to the international public. ANDRAX enable to all Android and ARM device with root access and storage become a weapon for Advanced Penetration Testing and Red Team operations. ANDRAX is developed by Weidsom Nascimento of The Cracker Technology - Advanced Pentest Why is Android and ARM so powerful? Simple, everyone has a smartphone and spends all the time with it! We have the possibility to camouflage easily in the middle of everyone, the processor architecture of most Android smartphones is ARM a modern and robust architecture extremely superior to the rest, With touch screens we can run the tools with great agility and take advantage of the graphical interface of Android, we can get in almost anywhere with our smartphones... If you do not understand how great it is you're not a Penetration Tester! With Android we have a lot of power in our hands, we can do everything we do with a desktop and more. ARM is the best architecture for processor, x86 is dead, computers are redefined nowadays! Why ANDRAX is better? Let's see why ANDRAX is the best Penetration Testing Platform... Portable ANDRAX is portable for any Android Smartphone using Android 5+ and space left and any ARM board like Raspberry Pi HardBased ANDRAX uses the most advanced structure inside the default Linux structure, this mean that ANDRAX can isolate process and install things with conflicting libs and resources in the same environment. With HardBased we an get a secured environment to run non trusted codes and/or deploy some types of tests that is not possible in others systems Modern ANDRAX is a modern platform, we have new tools that is not included on others system, we like the idea of give new tools and resources for professionals, others platforms are made by dinosaurs that like old things who not work on nowadays.

But since the creation of ANDRAX I have been striving to bring a safe, efficient, high performance and free system to everyone. Today I can say that I did it! At great cost, ANDRAX has become the best platform for Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking in the world. The most Advanced, Reliable and Complete platform, targeting any type of system in any architecture and language! ANDRAX becomes the most dangerous weapon that can be armed and ready in anyone's pocket! NetHunter is restricted NetHunter is restricted and the developers appear don't know about the Android's power, they do things thinking in normal Linux distributions that has old models and is not useful for nowadays. The NetHunter has focus on some devices targeting a type of \"easy tracking\"... ANDRAX is portable and full featured with focus in Android resources, we support all devices with minimal requirements. We not restrict our resources and our goal is bring a real Penetration Testing Platform for everyone! Kali and NetHunter is old and outdated The developers of Kali and NetHunter are old guys who live in a outdated world! All tools on Kali and NetHunter are from a past who turn 90% of they unusable nowadays. ANDRAX by other way is a modern platform created and developed by just one young developer, born on 1997 and who started work as a hacker at the age of 08, everything in ANDRAX is focused to work and old systems are replaced every month by moderns tools! Kali and NetHunter don't care about security or professionals Offensive Security don't care about security or security professionals, they only want produce and maintain a army of lammers to sell courses the only thing that they care about is money, this mean make you a dependent like a drugs sellers! This will change your mind and you never will be able to evolute like a professional because you have your mind closed like all others youtube dumbs! Technical details about ANDRAX superiority! Now let's talk more deep about ANDRAX superiority over Kali, NetHunter and any others! Advanced terminal Is not a secret that the NetHunter terminal is a really, really old and ugly version of \"Android Terminal Emulator\" that was a good terminal (for ls and pwd command) many years ago. The NetHunter terminal is ugly and unusable for anything! This is a fact! The ANDRAX Terminal by other way is the most Advanced terminal emulator for Android, with the best implementations made by who really know what is Hacking! Don't you think? Ok, check this out: ANDRAX Dragon Terminal Artificial Intelligence ANDRAX is made with a AI engine by default, nowadays Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking needs more than just a guy running tools, you need a more complex system, one of the best to do that is MLP-N (Multi Layer Perceptron Network). ANDRAX has LIBFANN by default in your libs sets, everything configured to start developing MLP networks using the C and C++ languages. M.A.R.I.N.A is a dedicated tool using MLP networks to Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing, is under construction and growing up really fast, every time that M.A.R.I.N.A is started she learn and become more powerful! More tools ANDRAX has more tools than any other platform, at the moment more than 3000 tools and growing up every week! Modern tools ANDRAX has a policy of add newer and modern tools as soon as they are launched, others platform like Kali wait the tools become useless to include then in the repo! Explicit categories Kali, Parrot and others use a \"category system\" to create a mask in they tools lacks, as they don't have much tools, they create categories repeating many times the same tools to create the illusion of have many then... but is a lie! ANDRAX has a simple and dedicated category system to not repeat tools like dumbs platforms! Mobile Telecom SS7 SIGTRAN DIAMETER UMTS LTE 2G 3G 4G 5G ANDRAX is equipped with Advanced tools for Mobile Network Hacking like 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G using GPRS, UMTS and LTE technologies, systems like Kali and Parrot is made by people who don't know what is, they don't have expertise to work with these advanced topics so this is a point that ANDRAX ever will be superior! ICS and SCADA Industrial Control System nowadays is a essential category to a Advanced Hacker... but Kali users don't know much about this world! Because they are not Advanced! ANDRAX users by other way has many resources to Advanced Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing in ICS and SCADA platforms! IoT and IIoT Hacking In the first, is not possible run IoT and IIoT attacks natively in Kali, Parrot and others... Why? Because they are made for old systems (Personal Computers) using a old architecture (x86), ANDRAX by other way is made for smartphones with all hardware sensors and chipsets by default (NFC, BLE, WIFI...) and ARM boards like Raspberry Pi. Internet of Things dominates our world nowadays, as a Hacker you need be a expert in this area! If you know how to hack IoT devices you know how to hack the entire world, but you need the right platform and the right platform is ANDRAX! BGP Exploitation ANDRAX is the first and unique platform with integrated tools to attack the Border Gateway Protocol! Mainframe Hacking ANDRAX is the first and unique platform with dedicated tools to Hacking and Exploit mainframes! Wait... aren't mainframes dead? No! Mainframes is used in banks, financial institutions, airplane companies, companies like Google and others! Mainframe are extremely used in big data and our world is based in big data, but dumb users of Kali, NetHunter, Parrot, BlackArch and others don't know about advanced topics like modern mainframe hacking! Advanced Web Site Hacking Systems like Kali has a focus in monopoly tools like \"burp suite\" that is not Advanced or useful for nowadays but they insist on the mistake to keep the monopoly based on bribery and misinformation! ANDRAX by other way include the really Advanced resources and tools for Hacking Web Site and HTTP based applications! Advanced Password Hacking ANDRAX include the best tools and resources for Advanced Password Hacking including pre-computed resources, Online Cracking resources, fast induced password crackers... Wireless Hacking by Advanced way Unlike others systems ANDRAX is focused in Advanced attacks and methodologies, Our Wireless Hacking tools are pure customizables and dedicated for Advanced usage turning ANDRAX Wireless Hacking Category in the most Advanced if compared with others! Exploitation like a PRO The most Advanced resources for Advanced Exploitation, far beyond Metasploit, ANDRAX has thousands of frameworks, tools, resources, protocol stacks, libraries... for Advanced Exploitation that turn ANDRAX the All-In-One Hacking platform! Advanced EVASION for All type of Security Systems The best exploitation tools don't mean nothing if you can't avoid AV, IDS/IPS... and ANDRAX knows that so we have Security system bypass tools for all types! HardBased ANDRAX uses the most advanced structure inside the default Linux structure, this mean that ANDRAX can isolate process and install things with conflicting libs and resources in the same environment. With HardBased we an get a secured environment to run non trusted codes and/or deploy some types of tests that is not possible in others systems Optimized ANDRAX has a lot of optimizations enabled by default and hardcoded to bring the best experience to our users, ANDRAX is build to run in devices with low power, memory and processor power... NetHunter drain your battery in less than 2:30 hours and kill your SoC life in less than 3 months! Lightweight ANDRAX is extremely lightweight if compared with others systems, others systems require around 40GB of free space, ANDRAX only need 15GB to run at 100%.

Android has a SoC with a powerful Bluetooth chipset with modern BLE capabilities, you don't need use a external Bluetooth adapter as dumbs do! You just need your smartphone! How to enable Bluetooth in ANDRAX Android interact with the Bluetooth module using a serial port device who is created by the SoC Bluetooth driver, this allow us kill the Android Bluetooth interface and enable our own HCI interface attaching to this serial port, by this way we have a so fast connection with our Bluetooth module the connection speed is faster than any external adapter! (ANDRAX in top, again!) Finding the serial port Find the serial port to use in Android is pretty easy, everyone can easily find it without any help... but if you are a dumb created by Offensive Security we will help you! Just past the following commands on a ANDRAX recovery shell and you will be able to find your device serial port for Bluetooth connections: su cd /;cat *.rc | grep -i \"bluetooth\" | grep -i \"net_bt_stack\" | grep -i \"\\/dev\" After run the commands you will see a result like this: Now you know that your serial port for Bluetooth connections is located at \" /dev/ttyS0 \", whats next? The serial speed Now we will need attach to the serial port but to do that you need discover the \"baud\" speed of the serial port, we will go back to the ANDRAX shell and past the following command: sudo stty -F /dev/<your serial port> You will be able to see the result like this: As we can see my Bluetooth chipset have the speed of 3.000.000 bauds per second (bps) or 3 Megabits per second which is a very, very high speed for a local physical connection! We will use a low range speed because this chipset speed is shared with the entire modem SoC, this mean that is used by Mobile Network, WiFi, Bluetooth and any other type of connectivity chipset like NFC. For 99.9% of attack types we will use the speed of 115200 bauds per second that is more than a good speed. Attaching to the serial port We will use hciattach to attach to the serial port and create a hci interface, the basic syntax of the hciattach command is: sudo hciattach -s 115200 /dev/ttyS0 any 3000000 sudo : To get root privileges hciattach : The command to attach to the serial port -s 115200 : The initial speed to we work /dev/ttyS0 : The serial port device block any : The device manufacturer type 3000000 : My real device speed We have the device setup complete, now we will power up the interface with hciconfig, hciconfig has a syntax similar with the old ifconfig: sudo hciconfig hci0 up sudo : To get root privileges hciconfig : The command to manage the interface hci0 : The interface to power up up : The subcommand to up the interface Now everything is fine, our hci interface is up and running. To remove the lock and get you Android bluetooth working again just restart your device.
